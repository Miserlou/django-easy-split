django-easy-split
=================

Easy split testing for Django.

## Origins

This project is a direct descendant of [django-lean](https://github.com/e-loue/django-lean/). For now, it's probably
best that you swim upstream for whatever you are looking for.

django-easy-split intends to update and simplify django-lean. This may or may not ever actually come to fruition as a
useful product for the community - it may remain simply a mess of undocumented code only really useful for my own
purposes. Still, I'll be working in public for the most part, so we shall see.
